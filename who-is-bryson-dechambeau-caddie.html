This happened before the start of the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit, Mich. Tim was on duty during practice rounds, but by Thursday, Bryson had a new caddie named Ben Schomin, who comes from Cobra/Puma Golf.</p><p>Bryson's agent wanted to clarify that Tim wasn't let go or fired, and that it was a mutual decision between the two of them. “All good things come to end. Bryson and Tim are grateful for all the great times they had together. Like any player-caddie relationship, it ran its course. They mutually decided it was time to move on and both wish each other all the best in their future endeavors," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brett Falkoff said</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bryson DeChambeau and his caddie Tim Tucker part ways ahead of first round at Rocket Mortgage Classic. <a href=#>https://t.co/6qEpwQZ9ap</a></p>— GOLFonCBS (@GOLFonCBS) <a href=#>July 1, 2021</a></figure><p>The news was first reported by No Laying Up, which tweeted, "Source: Bryson's caddie, Tim Tucker, will not be on the bag for Bryson today.

Tim is an experienced caddie and player who was involved in the 2007 U.S. Mid Amateur Tournament as well as the 2013 Pacific Northwest Men's Amateur Championship. While not much is available about his personal life, we do know that Bryson and Tim had a great working relationship, and Bryson especially employed Tim because he used the vector green-reading system, which Bryson preferred.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/Tim Tucker</a></figure><p>According <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to Essentially Sports</a>, Tim earned a base salary of $120,000 as well as a payout of $353,801, which reportedly made him the sixth highest-paid caddie in 2020. Bryson has described Tim as having a "calming" effect on him and his game. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He added</a>, "He’s super easy and cool and collected. Whatever I say, it doesn’t bother him at all. We just go out there and have a good time.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Spoke with some Tour caddies about their reaction to Bryson splitting with his caddie Tim Tucker.<a href=#>https://t.co/SbG7xpkj80</a></p>— Garrett Johnston (@JohnstonGarrett) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Was there a specific reason why Tim quit? Not really. "It wasn’t one specific issue. It was a culmination. Like any caddie-player relationship, they had their ups and downs. They wish each other nothing but the best and will always be there for each other," Brett, Bryson's agent, said. However, according to Golf, Bryson wasn't the easiest person to work for, and the job was demanding.</p><p>"DeChambeau is frequently the last player on the driving range at night during tournament weeks. He had a well-publicized late-night session the Saturday before winning the U.S. Open at Winged Foot last September, and he also hit balls well past dark at last month’s U.S. Open at Torrey Pines," Golf reported.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who's Bryson DeChambeau's new caddie?</h2><p>Ben Schomin is Bryson's emergency caddie. The 43-year-old caddie, known for his epic mullet, is Cobra Golf's director of tour operations. Ben stated that he likes his current job, and likely wouldn't become Bryson's full-time caddie (he also told Golf Week he'd <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"have to ask his wife" </a>when asked about this). He apparently made a comment about how Bryson made him wear a hat in order to hide his mullet (did you really think there was no drama in golf?).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How Cobra's Ben Schomin became Bryson DeChambeau's emergency caddie at the Rocket Mortgage Classic <a href=#>https://t.co/s5Hjq9GDWU</a></p>— Golfweek (@golfweek) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Golf journalist Jason Sobel tweeted, "Texted last night with Ben Schomin, emergency caddie for Bryson DeChambeau.
