former Deputy National Chairman of Labour Party, (LP), Calistus Uju Okafor has tackled the former Anambra State Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Obi</a> over his inability to settle the crisis in the party.</h2><p class=p1>In an interview with journalists in Abuja, on Wednesday,&nbsp; Calistus Uju Okafor, who is currently challenging the constitutionality of the Abure-led national working committee of the party in Court, faulted the claims of Doyin Okupe that he was demanding N48 million to withdraw his case against the party.</p><p>Calistus said he is fighting for his right and justice, pointing out that Obi left the Peoples Democratic Party because of the injustice carried out against him.</p><p>He stated that he is not going to court for the sake of Obi, noting that his case has been instituted in court since&nbsp; 21st December 2021 before the former Anambra Governor joined the party on May 29th.</p><p>According to Calistus, Peter Obi is eager to change the narratives of the current politics in Nigeria but still unable to settle the crisis he met in LP.</p><p class=p1>He said: “I have read in the news media where Dr. Doyin Okupe was quoted to have said that I was demanding for N48m for the lawyers who have been representing me in Courts before I would withdraw my case against the Labour Party.</p><p class=p1>“I am however happy that he did not say that I have collected the said amount from anybody or group of people. I have also read the mischievous claim of a group that I had collected N15m draft to withdraw the case I instituted against the Labour Party. This is also not correct.</p><p class=p1>“I am fighting for my right, I’m fighting for Justice. Mr. Peter Obi left the Peoples Democratic Party because of the injustice carried out against him there. If Peter Obi could dump the PDP for LP in order to get justice, he should consider the case of someone who is looking for Justice.</p><p class=p1>“I have not been bought over by anyone. I want to let Nigerians especially the Igbo people know that I did not go to Court because of Peter Obi. I instituted my case in Court on December 21 2021 and 0bi joined the Labour Party on May 29.</p><p class=p1>“I was in court in January, February, March and April. It was after&nbsp; Obi joined in May that people started saying that I had been bought.</p><p class=p1>“Obi is fighting to become president while I am fighting to become the chairman of the LP based on the provisions of the constitution which empowers me to act as chairman if the chairman is removed or died.</p><p class=p1>“Obi is an Igbo man like me. He has never offended me. I have no reason to fight him.</p><p class=p1>“When the supporters of Obi came to me and demanded settlement. I asked where we would start from? I asked them whether it’s about the N48m I had spent on the case so far&nbsp; that they wasn’t to pay.</p><p class=p1>“On the 30th of June, I went to court with my lawyers including SANs. I have sold my house in Gwarinpa. I am ready to sell another house in Wuse 2 to continue fighting.</p><p class=p1>“If anyone thinks that anybody is sponsoring me, let that person have it in mind that when I started this battle, I did not see Obi in the picture.</p><p class=p1>“If Obi thinks he can come to the Labour Party and carry out injustice against me, like the way he was treated in the PDP, he is making a great mistake.</p><p class=p1>“If anyone also believes that I have collected money from Peter Obi, the person is making a mistake because I’m in Court. I have no hard feelings against anybody and I will not allow anyone to intimidate me with SANS.</p><p class=p1>“My case is coming up again on July 8. I have brought in two SANs.&nbsp; I know that there are people benefiting from the current situation who are making Peter Obi not to see the reality of life. They didn’t allow him to come into reality that he has no ticket with which to contest next year’s election yet.</p><p class=p1>“There are people telling Obi not to mind me thinking that my case had no merit. He (Obi) is paying lawyers, hundreds of millions instead of him to resolve the crisis in the&nbsp; Labour Party.&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>“This is a man who wants to change the narratives politically, who wants to do something differently but he could not settle the crisis he met on the ground. He cannot resolve the Labour party crisis and he want to resolve the problem of Nigeria.</p><p class=p1>“If anyone wants to crucify me for fighting for my my right, I’m also prepared to fight on, even to the logical end.</p><p class=p1>“This issue of Igbo man fighting another Igbo man is not correct. Nobody is sponsoring me. Instead of resolving the issue in the LP, Obi is spending millions of naira to hire senior advocates of Nigeria to intimidate me in court, he believes that his money would get him what he wants but we shall see the outcome at the end of the day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49wZq2qn6qvrbGMn6arZaCawaa%2BjKiZomWRqHqxvsSsoJ2dnqm2oriMmqSboaSevK95wqiknqtdqrulsdFmq6GqlZbBcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./feras-antoon-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Is Feras Antoon Now?
