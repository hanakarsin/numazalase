Initially, the producers of the show were planning to hire identical twins, who would play the same role as the title character. Their reasoning was that hiring twins was easier to manage and had a lower risk of violating the laws of child labour. However, the producers had no luck in their search for the twins, so they had to make a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">crucial decision</a> to cast one baby, and their attention was driven to the beautiful little Mia. The choice of casting her was risky, because the actions of such a young baby often depended on mood, and sometimes when she had bad days, she would not deliver quality performance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e067ba84e649aa1a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lia Marie Johnson bio: what happened to the young Youtuber?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Justin Berfield today: age, height, net worth, partner</p><p class=align-left>Still, even at such tender Mia Talerico age, she was quite obedient and felt comfortable on the set of the show, and this made the work of people involved in the filming much more manageable.
