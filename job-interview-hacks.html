rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Robin Zlotnick</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated July 17 2019, 3:23 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Columbia Pictures</span></figure><p>Especially these days, it's difficult to land a job. There are so many reasons for this, but you don't want the interview to be the reason you didn't get the gig. Recently, the people of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> came together to share their best tips and tricks for nailing your next job interview, impressing your potential future employer, and getting the job. Here are some of our favorite ones.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Don't ramble.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This first one is so important and something I totally have not mastered yet. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CautiousPie</a> says that it's important to learn that "not all of those awkward silences need to be filled by your rambling." Heck yes. This is a great one. Don't feel like you have to keep talking just because your interviewer doesn't cut you off. Answer their question precisely and concisely, then shut your mouth and wait for the next prompt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>To piggyback off of that one, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">-Beercules-</a> suggests bringing a bottle of water with you. If you take a brief sip of water after you answer a question, that signals the interviewer that you are finished talking and it helps fill what could potentially be an awkward silence.&nbsp;</p><p>It is always so tempting to fill that empty air with more words, but more words aren't always better. It's better to be clear and honest and then let the interviewer continue the process.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ask good questions.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>You should always be prepared with questions when you go into an interview. And make sure they're good ones! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Volvbro</a> says you should find out something specific you want to know about the company. This shows that you are curious about the company and about the position, and it also demonstrates that you have done your research about the place at which you will potentially be employed. That goes a long way for interviewers.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Also, remember that interviews are a two-way street. Sure, they are interviewing you to see if you would be a good fit for the position, but the interview is also a chance for you to learn more about the company and the culture firsthand, to really get an idea of what your life would be like should you decide to work there, and that's just as important as the other stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectrumero</a> reminds us that "you want to make sure the company's culture is one you can live with, that the company is stable and not about to collapse and leave you without work, and that the job is really as they've advertised it."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Admit when you don't know something.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This one is super important. Honesty is the always the best policy, and yes, that also applies to job interviews. If you don't know something, don't be afraid to admit that. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LifeRemains</a> reminds us that people aren't expected to know everything about everything. It's better to admit you don't know something, while expressing that you will absolutely make an effort to learn it, rather than to try and make up an answer that could be wrong.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>It's sometimes hard to remember, but the people who are interviewing you are human, too, and so you should try to act as normal as possible. No doubt interviews are stressful situations, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mrshakeshaft</a> wants us to remember not to pretend to be someone we're not. "Be interested and enthusiastic. Most people aren't looking for a cog in a wheel, they are trying to work out if they can stand having to work with you," they write. This is so true.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Part of that whole being human thing is admitting that you have room to improve. Yes, even in the interview stage. A good way to responsibly convey this is to do what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">-stormborn-</a> suggests: Ask if they have any concerns about your experience or your resume that might hold you back from the position.&nbsp;</p><p>They said that they got a job with that question. "The interviewer said it was a very confident request and something he'd never heard before."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Dress to impress.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>It can be so hard to know what to wear to an interview these days, especially since more and more offices are becoming casual. But you still want to dress to impress, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CockOnCall</a> reminds us. "Overdress every time," they write, and they are right. You don't have to wear a tuxedo like Will Ferrell in Step Brothers if you're applying for a warehouse job, but make sure you look presentable and professional and a little more dressed up than the people in the office.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Another simple thing that can add to your appearance and give off a professional vibe is to bring a notebook and take notes, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AlphaTangoFoxtrt</a> reminds us. I'm not kidding; I 100 percent got my first job out of college because I brought a notebook to the interview and took notes during it. I know this because when the interviewer called me as I was walking to my car after the interview to offer me the job, she told me this was one of the main reasons. It can go a long way.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>There's one specific question you can ask the hiring manager that pretty much solidifies you as a good interviewee, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">knitro</a>. Are you ready? Do you have a pen and paper? Because you might want to write this down. Ask the hiring manager, "What do you think are the biggest challenges the person who steps into this role faces and how do you measure success for that person?"</p><p>It's thoughtful, it will give you a comprehensive idea of the position and the expectations of the hiring manager, and it will give you a sense of them as a boss. This is a good piece of advice.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Practice makes perfect.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This great piece of advice comes from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bunglemort</a>. It's so simple, but so important: "Go to interviews." Any opportunity you get to interview for a job, even if it's a job you don't particularly want, do it. It's good practice. Interviewing is an art form, and the more you do it, the more you flex that muscle, the better at it you will be. So eventually, when that perfect job comes along, you will know exactly what you're doing and you will nail that interview no problem.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>It's also a good idea to try to relax and in some cases, crack jokes with your interviewer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyanide_Revolver</a> suggests this, and I think it's a good piece of advice, if it feels natural in the moment and if you're sure your joke won't offend someone or throw off the conversation in another way. This can be difficult to gauge, but I still think it's a good reminder to be yourself as much as possible in interviews... provided yourself knows how to skillfully tell a funny, innocuous joke.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Another interesting piece of advice comes from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McMonkrat</a>. They suggest mimicking the body language and posture of the interviewer in a subtle, nonchalant way. This is something that I know I do sort of subconsciously anyway, but it's a subtle way to illustrate that you are on the same page as your interviewer, that you are on their level, able to vibe with them, and willing to work to fit at their company.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Make eye contact.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This is another seemingly tiny gesture that can go further than you even know. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilsonthehuman</a> provides us with a great list of ways to be genuine and human in an interview, but possibly the most important among them is "Look them in the eye when they're talking." Making eye contact can be uncomfortable for some, but that human connection, that acknowledgment that you are confidently in this discussion with them, will do wonders.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><p>Last but not least, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharke087</a> leaves us with a great question to ask at the end of the interview, when everything else has been covered. They say it's worked for them 100 percent of the time so far, and I believe them. This is the question to end your interviews with: "So assuming I get this position, and let's be honest, I would really appreciate it. In six months to a year, what qualities or accomplishments will be the ones that remind you that you made the right choice in inviting me onto your team?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yjecinq56qpp6yuHnHmpqkqw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1393439-boy-dances-popular-song-praise-cool-moves-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Little Boy Becomes Sensation, Dances to Chris Brown's Song with Impressive 'Legwork', Causes Massive</a>
