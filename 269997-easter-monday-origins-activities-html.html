He had further added, "The spring equinox is a day where the amount of dark and the amount of daylight is identical.</p><p class=align-left>As an addition to the old pagan festivals, the feast days celebrated in the new church of the Christians were added. This had happened after Jesus' life, during the first few centuries.
