Like Vanderpump Rules and Kandi and the Gang, <a href=#>Southern Hospitality</a> will focus on Leva’s staff and the inevitable drama that occurs when multiple young, eligible employees work under one roof.</p><p>In Southern Hospitality, Leva leads with her magnetic personality fans watched on Southern Charm. However, who is in the rest of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Hospitality cast</a>? We’ve got all the details below!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Maddi Reese</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@madison_reese</a></figure><p>While fans aren’t used to the Southern Hospitality cast yet, Leva’s explosive cast is filled with her longtime staff members. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maddi Reese</a>, for instance, has worked at Republic for four years and is the VIP Hosts manager. Despite her promotion, Maddi wants to make it big in the music business and uses her job to perform and promote her music. The Charleston, S.C. transplant also has a hectic love life, which fans will see firsthand in Season 1.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mikel Simmons</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@mikelsimmons</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikel</a> works under Maddi as one of Republic’s VIP Hosts. While Mikel typically makes everyone at the lounge feel welcomed and ready to party, his personal struggles have plagued him from living authentically. However, Mikel is ready to come out to his family and loved ones despite the stigma he may face as a Black gay man living in the South.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Grace Lilly</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@glillyvibes</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace</a> is Republic’s VIP Concierge with strong southern roots. Although she grew up in the south, Grace wants to see much more than Charleston. When she isn’t traveling and partying worldwide, the astrologer prioritizes self-care by routinely not showing up for her shifts. It’s unclear how Leva feels about Grace’s work ethic, but it will likely come up this season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe Bradley</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@joecbradley</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe</a> is another VIP Host who feels he has something to prove. The Atlanta native grew up with a prosperous family but has tried to make a name for himself by moving to Charleston and working multiple entry-level jobs. Now that he’s found his calling as a host, Joe’s ambitious drive could affect his and Mikel’s relationship and connections with his other co-workers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lucia Pena</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@@sunshinelu13</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucia</a> is originally from New York and is one of Republic’s VIP servers during the night shift. When she’s not working, Lucia navigates her personal life, which includes her 2-year-old son and a complicated relationship with her baby daddy. Lucia and her ex have been in an on-and-off romance for quite some time. In Season 1, fans will see if she can make their relationship work for good when they decide to give each other another chance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TJ Dinch</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@tj_dinch</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TJ</a> often speaks his mind at Republic, but has the experience to do so. The Virginia native moved to Charleston to specifically thrive in the food and beverage industry and eventually transitioned to the lounge’s bartender. As the bartender, he strives to protect the business’s brand, even when it’s unwarranted. In the new season, TJ’s actions will affect his relationships with his co-workers, Grace and Mikel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mia Alario</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@miaalario</a></figure><p>Leva hired <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mia</a> as Republic’s Hostess, though she doesn’t need the job. The double economics graduate has a day job working at a financial institution and seemingly wants to stay there and keep Republic for a reason to go out and have a good time. Mia is always down for a party. Unfortunately, her “outspoken” and unfiltered opinions land her in trouble with her co-workers. Some have even questioned if Mia is committed to her position.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Kulp</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@will_kulp</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will</a> works as a bartender at Republic and isn’t quite sure what he wants his next move to be. The Charleston native had a stint in New York where he began trying out for modeling jobs after being discovered by a talent scout. When he eventually moved back home with his parents, Will used his disappointment to criticize his fellow staff members. This season, fans will see if Will steps up and applies himself at work or pursues a career in law. Additionally, Will and his girlfriend, Emmy, will provide a glimpse into their romance.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emmy Sharrett</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/ @emmysharrett</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emmy</a> is the lounge’s VIP server and a recent College of Charleston graduate waiting for her first post-college job. Emmy and Will are Republic’s golden couple, and Leva describes them as having a “flawless outward appearance.” Unfortunately, the good times won’t last long, as a scandal involving one of Emmy’s co-worker’s boyfriends could end her and Will’s relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bradley Carter</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@bradnboujee_</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley</a> is another one of Republic’s VIP Hosts, but he started out pursuing a different career. The Citadel military college graduate has ambitions to become a personal trainer — and certainly has the body and fitness regimen to prove it. His looks often get him in trouble, though, as he seemingly doesn’t mind dating his co-workers. During the season, one bartender accused Bradley of cheating on them with another bartender, which he denies. Nonetheless, the rumors could damage the team’s hard work and solid bond.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is ‘Southern Hospitality’s’ premiere date?</h2><p>Bravo announced plans to premiere Southern Hospitality Season 1 at the network’s annual BravoCon event.
