2022.</h2><p>The glaring difficulty President Muhammadu Buhari and his ruling&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;are having in picking the standard-bearer of the party in next year’s presidential election is a telling epitaph of how the country has been run these seven years. It eloquently summarizes what is at the heart of the malaise plaguing the government at the center. The same tardiness that made the government take over six months to assemble an underwhelming cabinet in 2015 seems to be at play here. How can a party whose forms are the most expensive not diligently be about its business and treat same with dispatch? Even after reportedly getting&nbsp;INEC to extend the “fixed and firm” June 3 deadline&nbsp;for the conduct of political parties primaries, APC is still at sea as to how or who to pick among its cleared presidential aspirants, despite spying on its neighbour, the PDP.</p><p>It was therefore heartwarming that the party was able to pull off its screening of its overcrowded presidential battlefield, pruning the number from 23 to 13. But with the chairman of the screening panel, John Odigie-Oyegun, disclosing that only youthful aspirants made the list of cleared aspirants, we hope that this won’t create further upheaval in the polity, particularly as a leading aspirant in the party yesterday indicated that he truly means to fight dirty in his quest to actualize a lifetime ambition.</p><p>The national leader of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has given reasons for his now viral outburst in Ogun.</p><p>Recall that Tinubu had boasted, while speaking to APC delegates in Ogun, that Buhari wouldn’t have been president without his help.</p><p>He also claimed to be behind the emergence of Yemi Osinbajo as vice president and Dapo Abiodun as governor of Ogun State.</p><p>Tinubu’s statement has drawn widespread condemnation, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir David Lawal,&nbsp;describing the APC leader’s claim as bullsh*t.</p><p>Reacting to the backlash, Tinubu’s Campaign Director, Media & Communications, Bayo Onanuga described interpretations of the viral video as erroneous, misleading and mischievous.</p><p>He stated that the fresh conditions proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari for the consideration of a presidential candidate of the APC made it necessary for Tinubu to labour to convince the delegates that he fits the bill.</p><p>The John Odigie-Oyegun led Presidential Screening Committee of the ruling&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;has disqualified 10 of the 23 presidential aspirants of the party.</p><p>The committee is currently at the National Secretariat of the party submitting its report to the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee NWC.</p><p>The All Progressives Congress’ presidential committee has disqualified 10 aspirants from its primaries scheduled for next week.</p><p>Oyegun, a former Edo State governor, said only 13 out of the 23 aspirants screened were cleared by the committee.</p><p>Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir David Lawal has lambasted the national leader of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p><p>Babachir Lawal, a staunch ally of Tinubu, berated the former Lagos governor for taking credit for Muhammadu Buhari’s emergence as president in 2015.</p><p>Recall that Tinubu had boasted, while speaking to APC delegates in Ogun, that&nbsp;Buhari wouldn’t have been president without his help.</p><p>President&nbsp;Muhammadu Buhari&nbsp;has assented to the new Appropriation Bill recently passed into law by the National Assembly.</p><p>Naija News reports that the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives), Umar I. El-Yakub, made this known in a statement on Friday.</p><p>El-Yakub disclosed that the new law repeals the Appropriation Law passed by the lawmakers in December 2021.</p><p>He said the new Act increases the size of the federal budget for 2022 to ₦17,319 trillion. ₦817,699 billion is for statutory transfer, while N3.978 trillion will go to debt service.</p><p>Human rights lawyer, Kayode Ajulo has called on the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;to disqualify the former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.</p><p>In a statement on Friday to newsmen, Ajulo said Amaechi was unfit and&nbsp;not eligible to contest for the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>Citing section 137 (1)(i) of the 1999 constitution, the lawyer said Amaechi cannot run for office owing to the allegation of N96 billion fraud against him.</p><p>Recall that Governor Nyesom Wike had set up a probe panel which had indicted Amaechi and some other persons over the alleged withdrawal of N96 billion from the state’s treasury.</p><p>The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has released guidelines for the conduct of the&nbsp;2023 general elections.</p><p>Eight months before the 2023 general elections, the nation’s electoral body on Friday (today), released revised rules and regulations that must be adhered to by citizens and aspirants for a smooth exercise,&nbsp;Naija News&nbsp;reports.</p><p>INEC said in the guidelines that irregularities and acts of hooliganism would not be tolerated during the exercise, as security operatives have been tasked to monitor the process.</p><p>Among other things, security agents that would be available at polling units and collation centres, have been tasked to tightly ensure that the Polling Units, counting of ballots, collation and declaration of results are conducted without any disturbance.</p><p>The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola is reportedly backing the presidential bid of Vice President&nbsp;Yemi Osinbajo.</p><p>It was gathered that Aregbesola, a former Osun governor, won’t back the ambition of his former political mentor, Bola Tinubu.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that Aregbesola and Tinubu are rumoured to be at loggerheads over the running of Osun State.</p><p>A source familiar with the APC campaign in the South-West told Vanguard that all Aregbesola boys are now working for Tinubu.</p><p>The hearing in the extradition case against the suspended former head of the IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT),&nbsp;Abba Kyari, has been fixed forAugust 29.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;report the US Government had requested the Nigerian authorities to release Kyari in view of his alleged link with international fraud suspect,&nbsp;Abbas Ramon&nbsp;popularly known as Hushpuppi.</p><p>The Federal Government then approached the court for permission to extradite Kyari to the United States of America to face charges of his alleged link with the suspected fraudster.</p><p>In a ruling on Friday, the presiding judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja fixed the date for the judgement on the matter.</p><p>There are indications that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose may work against the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)&nbsp;if Bola Tinubu emerges the presidential candidate of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>According to sources, Wike and Fayose strong relationship with Tinubu may see them support the former Lagos governor.</p><p>The source who spoke to Vanguard revealed why President Muhammadu Buhari refused to announce his successor when he met with APC governors.</p><p>He also dismissed insinuations that Buhari was looking to the North to pick his successor.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
