Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Like many other artists (including his ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift),<a href=#> Harry Styles</a> writes songs about his exes. Though many singers don't explicitly say which ex their song is about, Harry didn't leave much to the imagination in one song off his album "Fine Line."</p><p>In "Cherry," Harry includes a voicemail from none other than his ex-girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille Rowe</a>. He and the French model dated for a year beginning in 2017, but the cause of their split was unknown. In "Fine Line," Harry hints at potentially cheating on the model, and in "Cherry," he lets Camille do some of the talking.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Cherry" voicemail on the Harry Styles' album's translation</a> has arrived. Read on to find out what the singer included on the track, and what it says about his relationship with Camille.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The "Cherry" voicemail translation from Harry's album is here.</h2><p>Unlike his other fruit-themed song on the album, "Watermelon Sugar," "Cherry" is a somber track about how Harry doesn't want to hear from an ex because she's now happy with someone else. He even refers to himself as "selfish" for being upset that his ex is doing well.</p><p>"Don't you call him 'baby' / We're not talking lately / Don't you call him what you used to call me," Harry sings in the honest song.&nbsp;</p><p>While these lyrics could have been applied to any of his exes, there were a few hints in the song that it was about Camille Rowe. The first was the lyric, &nbsp;"I just miss your accent and your friends / did you know I still talk to them." Camille is from France, so this checks out.</p><p>The confirmation that the song was about Camille came at the end, when Harry put several snippets from voicemails she left for him in a row.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The voicemails are in French, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Genius</a> translated Camille's calls into English.</p><p><strong>"Hey! Are you asleep? Oh, I’m sorry…" Camille says in the first one.<br>"Well, no… Nope, it’s not important…" she next says.<br>"Well then… We went to the beach and now we —" Camille tells Harry, trailing off.<br>"Perfect, Harry!"&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The inclusion of the voicemails took listeners by storm because Harry has never really opened up about who the subject of his songs were before. He even ate cod sperm on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Late Late Show's "Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts</a>" to avoid telling ex Kendall Jenner what songs off his eponymous album were about her.</p><p>The somewhat intimate nature of the voicemails also led many to wonder if Camille knew that they would be featured on "Cherry," or if she was blindsided by it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Harry Styles tell Camille about using her voicemails in the song?</h2><p>While some artists who use voicemails don't seek permission from the person (like when Drake's ex-girlfriend sued him over using her voicemail on 'Marvin's Room'), Harry said that he asked Camille if he could use her voice on the track.</p><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zane Lowe for Apple Music</a> back in November Harry discussed why he wanted to put the voicemails in the song, and how he went about getting permission from his ex to do so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"It's a weird one for me because I don't like to explain songs or explain the meaning behind it and stuff like that," Harry said about all the speculation about "Cherry's" subject.&nbsp;</p><p>"But, with this record, it's almost like more open that it's like, 'well, you've told us.' Like, it tells you what it is. The thing I like about where this record went, especially compared to the last one, is... I can be as honest as possible, and the time when you can decide if it's too honest is when you're putting it out, and I never want to trim that stuff down," he said.</p><p>Harry said that he wanted "Cherry" to represent the way he was feeling when he was going through the breakup, which he said was "not great."</p><p>"Who was speaking at the end?" Zane asked.</p><p>"That was my ex-girlfriend," Harry confirmed about the voicemails.</p><p>"It got added in later on, and it felt so part of the song," he said. "It just felt like it needed it. We're friends, so I asked her if it was okay, and she was okay with it."</p><p>"What did she think of the song?" Zane then asked.</p><p>"I think she liked it," Harry said with a smirk on his face.</p><p>Harry also opened up to Zane about making "Fine Line" a more personal album than his first.</p><p>"Even just coming into this record, I wanted to feel a little less guarded with stuff," he told Zane. "I wanted to feel a lot freer and just more joyful and honest. I think a lot of the time, when there's tabloid stuff, for example, of people breaking up, I think people forget that there's a person who's also broken up with someone, which is sad. You get sad when you break up with someone."</p><p>Harry's intensely personal album "Fine Line" is out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWmvtGyZK%2BnmZiyrq3IpWShmaKnxm7A0ZqlrKSRqbawug%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nathaniel-curtis-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nathaniel Curtis - Age, Family, Bio</a>
