rel=noopener>Peoples Democratic Party</a> (PDP) has rejected claims by the presidency that it is responsible for the economic rot, insecurity, and other ills plaguing Nigeria.</h2><p>The PDP in a series of tweets on Sunday in response to the <strong>Muhammadu Buhari</strong> led presidency and the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>All Progressives Congress</a></strong> described the APC’s claim as a feeble kick of a weak horse.</p><p>The major opposition party maintained that Nigerians are tired of the <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> administration and the APC’s misrule in the past six years.</p><p>It alleged that the things the APC and the President Buhari administration have delivered to Nigeria since it claimed power in 2015 is a long list of unfulfilled promises, weak economy, increased poverty, surging unemployment, banditry, kidnapping, and other vices pointing to a failed state.</p><p>Earlier, <strong>Naija News</strong> had reported that the presidency in <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>an opinion article</a></strong> by the Senior Special Assistant to <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> on Media and Publicity, <strong>Garba Shehu</strong> claimed the PDP plunged Nigeria into a series of problems during its 16-year rule.</p><p>The APC alleged the PDP turned the country into a nation of scams promoting corruption to an industrial scale; exploiting the country’s oil, mineral, and land resources for selfish reasons.</p><p>However, the PDP in response has maintained its stand that Nigerians are tired of the APC as well as the Buhari administration and are eagerly waiting for 2023 to vote them out.</p><p>The opposition party responded that; “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) describes the diatribe by the Muhammadu Buhari Presidency against the party as a feeble kick of a weak horse, in another failed attempt to beguile Nigerians.”</p><p>“The PDP is not surprised that the Buhari Presidency is rattled by the bitter truth that Nigerians are fed up with President Buhari as well as his All Progressives Congress (APC) party and are rallying on our platform to rescue our nation from misrule.”</p><p>“It is indeed pathetic that the Buhari Presidency thinks that it can beguile Nigerians again after all they got from it in almost six years are failed promises, a wrecked economy, weak currency, excruciating poverty, surging unemployment, unbridled treasury looting, patronizing of bandits, terrorists and kidnappers, double economic recession and a rapid decline to the horrible status of a failed state.”</p><p>The PDP said needless borrowings under the Buhari/APC administration has turned Nigeria into a ‘beggar nation’ and the poverty capital of the world in just six years.</p><p>“Under President Buhari, all security, economic, and social indicators have gone negative. It, therefore, amounts to a slap on the sensibility of Nigerians for the Buhari Presidency to attempt to compare the once thriving lives of Nigerians under the PDP to the sorry state of affairs in our country, which has become a terrorist haven and world poverty capital in a space of six years.”</p><p>“What can the Presidency say to the fact that when President Buhari took over power in 2015, our economy was rated one of the fastest growing in the world with Fitch’s B+ rating, only for his administration to wreck it within six years, turned our country into a beggar nation that is now borrowing from all parts of the world?”</p><p>The PDP went ahead to list economic indices that have been on a downward trend since the APC and President Buhari assumed the leadership of Nigeria in 2015.</p><p>“When President Buhari took over from the PDP, our naira was at N160 to a dollar. Today under the incompetent and corrupt administration of APC and Buhari, our naira has fallen to almost N500 to a dollar, wrecking our national purchasing power and making Nigeria an object of jest among the comity of nations.”</p><p>“Why won’t Nigerians be fed up with the Buhari Presidency when under its watch, more than 30 million businesses have collapsed, while over 60M Nigerians have lost their means of livelihood due to obnoxious economic policies that scare away both domestic & foreign investors?”</p><p>“Why won’t Nigerians be fed up with the Buhari Presidency when under its voodoo economy, a liter of fuel, which sold for N87 per liter under the PDP, now sells as high as N170 to N200 under the Buhari and APC’s Eldorado economy.”</p><p>“Today, staple food had gone beyond the reach of majority of Nigerians so much so that a bag of rice which sold for about N10,000 now sells for N30,000; that a measure of garri which sold for N100 now sells for N350 to N400 and a liter of palm oil which sold for N200 now sells for up to N600? The list is endless.”</p><p>“Under Buhari’s watch, most families cannot afford basic necessities of life; parents cannot pay their children’s school fees, abandoned projects litter the nation; hunger and starvation, divorces, broken families, strange disease and sudden death have become so prevalent that compatriots prefer suicide and slavery mission as options.”</p><p>“Is it not distressing that terrorists that have been pushed to the fringes by the PDP administration have resurged and now being patronized by government officials as they ravage our communities and behead our citizens?”</p><p>The opposition party argued that despite claims by the Buhari administration that it is fighting corruption, corruption is now the order of the day in every government affair while the President himself can’t defend the direction he is leading the nation.</p><p>“Today, not only that corruption has increased in our nation under President Buhari as reported by reputable organizations like Transparency International, Nigeria now ranks as the third country with the highest level of terrorism in 2019, after Iran and Afghanistan.”</p><p>“Indeed, the situation is so bad that even Mr. President could not summon the courage to honour an invitation by the House of Representatives to give account of how his administration has managed the affairs of our nation.”</p><p>“Why won’t Nigerians crave for the return of the PDP, a party whose administration paid our foreign debts, grew the economy, revolutionized the telecommunication, aviation, power, agriculture, and banking sectors among others, and gave life a meaning in Nigeria.”</p><p>“The only achievement by the Buhari Presidency is stagnating the economy, mortgaging of our sovereignty through accumulation of foreign debt, increase in taxes and tariffs, reneging in all its promises and making life unbearable for the people.”</p><p>“As a party, the PDP challenges the Buhari Presidency to search its conscience, reflect on the devastations it has brought on our nation and accept that life is better under the PDP.” the party submitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49sZputmJa%2FqnnAp5tmmaCYeqmt1Z5kra2io7Klec2inp6qmZZ6qrrTqGSaZZKatKit0WalmqyZpLtutc1mbWaxlZa%2FtHnPnadmqpWluaqx0manq52jnrGmusKyZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./did-stabler-and-benson-have-an-affair.html>&#171;&nbsp;Did 'Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU's Elliot and Olivia Ever Hook Up?</a>
