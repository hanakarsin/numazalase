There have been tensions between them since the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, which took place on Sept. 13, 2009. While the then-fresh-faced country singer was accepting the Moonman for Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me,” Kanye ambushed her on stage, took the mic, and said: “Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> had one of the best videos of all time!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>No, that was not scripted.

In the song, Taylor seemingly is claiming that she forgives him, claiming that he's still "Innocent" in her eyes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>A few years pass and Taylor and Kanye appear to be friendly in the public eye.
