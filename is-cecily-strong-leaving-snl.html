While some folks inevitably stay on the program longer than others, whether it's because they've decided to go in another direction with their career, or it's time to part ways, fans of the show who've seen their favorite comedian or personality leave can get a bit down in the dumps following their departure.

It’s also taught me to be grateful."</p><p>Davidson also talked about his future on Saturday Night Live in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">February 2020 interview</a>, namely that he's "happy to be there as long as Lorne likes me."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Saturday Night Live/YouTube</span></figure><p>The comic took some time off from the show in spurts order to film Suicide Squad and King of Staten Island.
