President elect. Donald Trump is lobbying for the Supreme Court to intervene, citing election fraud and improper counting of ballots in order to stay in the White House.</p><p>The Associated Press reports <a href=#>Trump's </a>economic advisor, Larry Kudlow that "He intends to fight."</p><p>The "fight" being a campaign to paint Biden's 2020 victory as one that is tainted, something Roger Stone spoke to when asked if he thought the President would ever concede. "I doubt it. [Biden will then have] a cloud over his presidency with half the people in the country believing that he was illegitimately elected."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Big press conference today in Philadelphia at Four Seasons Total Landscaping — 11:30am!</p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>November 7, 2020</a></figure><p>AP continued that this could possibly be a plan of attack for Donald Trump to run for re-election in another four years and that he is attempting to launch his own media empire, absorbing the viewers of many conservative outlets like Fox News and retaining his most die-hard loyalists. The outlet also looked to the "support" of his "inner circle" who wants him to keep calling for voter fraud, which includes his personal lawyer and former Mayor of NY, Rudy Giuliani.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I could write jokes for 800 years and I'd never think of something funnier than Trump booking the Four Seasons for his big presser, and it turning out to be the Four Seasons Total Landscaping parking lot between a dildo store and a crematorium. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P45HV1daD9</a></p>— Zack Bornstein (@ZackBornstein) <a href=#>November 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Which brings us to the press conference in question that occurred outside of a Philadelphia Landscaping business: the Four Seasons. People couldn't stop laughing at the fact that the impromptu gathering was at the Four Seasons...Landscaping which was sandwiched between a crematorium and an adult book store.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What in the actual... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FbOio5ZZPA</a></p>— Richard Hall (@_RichardHall) <a href=#>November 7, 2020</a></figure><p>The President's sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have reportedly implored their dad to maintain his position, that he did not lose the election, and they've even called upon other Republican leaders to join them. However, the GOP does seem divided on its stance on whether or not to welcome Biden into the White House just yet. Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland has congratulated Biden, Fred Upton from Michigan did the same.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here’s the “all the networks” moment <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/j9UFzme4DE</a></p>— Zack Bornstein (@ZackBornstein) <a href=#>November 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Senator Mitt Romney, Adam Kinzinger, Tom Reed, Phil Scott, and Will Hurd are all notably GOP figures, among others, who've openly congratulated and/or welcome Biden into the White House. Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz, however, have contested that there was voter fraud occurring in a number of swing states, which is a sentiment shared by many Trump supporters in Pennsylvania, where many predict a recount will indeed take place.</p><p>In other states where the number of ballots were close, like Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, recounts could happen as well, but that will depend on each individual state's willingness to participate in a recount or not.</p><p>For many, however, Trump's press conference outside of the Four Seasons Landscaping is a death knell for his shot at staying in the White House come 2020.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I need to know if this is really what happened.

If he successfully manages to establish a media empire in that time, he could very well make another run in that time, depending on the political landscape and the initiatives that Biden's administration will pass.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey, our location is perfect for our needs... back off, man.

Once he had announced his intention to run as Republican, he vilified anyone who got in his way. It was a tool that unequivocally worked and he tired out the opposition on the podium with his campaign utilizing social media analytics to spread his messaging far and wide.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Part of what's so amazing is that they went ahead with it & put up posters for the backdrop & the podium, etc. The staging is...chef's kiss!</p>— Lisa Diedrich (@lldiedrich) <a href=#>November 8, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wow.

On Thursday, the Trump campaign won an appellate ruling to get party and campaign observers closer to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.
