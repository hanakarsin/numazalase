To them, it meant potential surgeries in their then 4-year-old's future.

So although Jackson still hasn't had any surgeries on his legs, the couple is being diligent in keeping an eye on his growth.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Jackson Roloff have surgery on his legs?</h2><p>Fast-forward to today, and Jackson is now 5 years old — and he has successfully had surgery on his legs.</p><p>On Nov. 30, 2021, Tori took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to share a photo of her son recovering from his operation. "Our sweet Jackson had surgery today to help correct the bowing in his legs.This kid time and time again blows us away," Tori wrote. "He was so brave and confident.

Zach explained on Little People, Big World that he had to have two surgeries at different points in his childhood which resulted in painful physical therapy. Zach did go on to play soccer and even coach a team, but he had difficulties that aren't lost on Tori.</p><p>Luckily for <a href=#>Tori</a>, despite her ongoing concerns for her children's health, Zach has been able to remain calm where she can't, given his own experience with health problems growing up.
