In the series, James "Bo" Bowden describes himself as an idiot savant who "fumbled his way through life." Bowden grew up in Alaska and used the military to escape the large but limited state. He found himself in Fort Carson, Colo. in August 1997, where chosen family became a priority.</p><p>It was there that Bowden met Rich Fritz. The two became fast friends with Rich stepping into the role of mentor. One thing Bowden respected about his friend was Rich's love for his family, which included his son Christian and wife Tammy. When Rich died in June 2001, it was devastating for Bowden who decided to leave the military right then and there. That's when Tammy reached out and offered Bowden a free place to stay. Sadly nothing in life is free. Things with Tammy Fritz went south. Where is she now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Tammy Fritz now?</h2><p>On May 26, 2015, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gazette</a> reported that Tammy was sentenced to 48 years in prison for two counts of attempted first-degree murder as well as two counts of solicitation of attempted first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. If you're asking yourself, "Was Bowden the person she tried to kill?" The answer is, yes.</p><p>Bowden moved in with Tammy and Christian in December 2001. In his mind she was like his family, by extension, because he unabashedly loved Rich. Their relationship was never romantic in nature and was more like an older sister. She was also very helpful in terms of Bowden's finances. She made sure everything of importance was kept in her fire-proof safe. That didn't seem strange to Bowden at the time, but it was significant later on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Bo Bowden?</h2><p>One night after they had been living together for about four years, Tammy and Bowden were drinking away her relationship troubles when he began to feel too drunk. Bowden's level of intoxication didn't match the amount of alcohol he had, but he didn't suspect a thing as he took himself to bed. The following morning, Bowden could not move and was rushed to the hospital. Test results were inconclusive but Bowden was suspicious. He moved out in February 2006.</p><p>By 2009, Tammy was on her own with Christian and began using drugs heavily. That's when she met Michelle Kay Heaston, 40 and Sean Richard Lagoe, 42. By July of that year, Tammy was being investigated for identity theft, credit card fraud, and check fraud. Her employer, a construction company, ended up firing her for misappropriating funds. She was writing checks from her employer's account that were then cashed by Heaston and Lagoe. At this time, Bowden was also unemployed, broke, and depressed.</p><p>Bowden decided to move back to Alaska with his parents in order to go back to school. When he told Tammy this, she was furious. Clearly high on something, she would rant about it in front of Christian. The weekend before Bowden was supposed to move, they all decided to have one last hurrah together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>The three of them had a grand time with Heaston. They went out and played pool then ended up back at the apartment where they played video games. Tammy and Christian were supposed to drive Bowden to the airport the next day, so they left. That night Christian woke up to find the house empty. His mother, Heaston, and Lagoe were nowhere to be found.</p><p>It turns out they were back at Bowden's place. On Aug. 3, 2009 Christian went over to Bowden's house but he never answered. Tammy and Christian tried calling, but Bowden didn't answer. She put Christian in the car and began making phone calls that Christian said were very strange. Bowden's mom, worried after not hearing from her son, had the apartment manager pop into his place. The manager opened the door and saw blood, then called the police who found Bowden unconscious in bed. He suffered a traumatic brain injury.</p><p>It turns out Tammy had taken out a life insurance policy on Bowden and ordered Heaston and Lagoe to kill him so she could collect the money. Thankfully that didn't work out. Apart from Tammy's conviction, her cohorts also received prison sentences though both are currently free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6uudhmnauhpK96r7vW</p></div><div id=links><a href=./413871-bernard-bossor-meet-23-year-ghanaian-teacher-blessing-society-passion-footwears-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bernard Bossor: Meet 23-Year-Old Teacher Blessing Society with His Passion for Footwear</a>
