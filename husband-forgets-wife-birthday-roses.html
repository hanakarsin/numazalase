The <a href=#>TikToker</a>, who goes by Princess (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@princess_per</a>) on the popular social media platform, received some flowers from a friend of hers.</p><p>She then left her camera recording and put her husband on the spot, thanking him for the flowers he bought her. His reaction and their subsequent conversation sparked a viral debate on the importance of folks in relationships celebrating each other's birthdays.</p><p>Princess's video begins with an on-screen caption that lets viewers in on the prank she's about to set up with a bouquet of flowers she received from a friend of hers: "My husband and kids forgot it was my birthday today. Watch what I did..." Princess writes, queuing up the gag in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@princess_per href=#>@princess_per</a><p>Loves marathon, joys endless sprint.@Momcozy Official <a title=momcozy href=#>#momcozy</a><a title=momcozylife href=#>#momcozylife</a><a title=momcozybreastpump href=#>#momcozybreastpump</a><a title=momcozypump href=#>#momcozypump</a><a title=comfelielife href=#>#comfelielife</a><a title=momcozyde href=#>#momcozyde</a><a title=momcozyuk href=#>#momcozyuk</a><a title=momcozyla href=#>#momcozyla</a><a title=momcozybaby href=#>#momcozybaby</a><a title=momcozysa href=#>#momcozysa</a><a title=momcozybra href=#>#momcozybra</a><a title=comfelie href=#>#comfelie</a><a title=babylifesharing href=#>#babylifesharing</a><a title=breastpump href=#>#breastpump</a><a title=wearablepumps href=#>#wearablepumps</a><a title=newborn href=#>#newborn</a><a title=sahm href=#>#sahm</a><a title=babiesoftiktok href=#>#babiesoftiktok</a><a title=momlife href=#>#momlife</a><a title=momcozyqxc href=#>#momcozyqxc</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - princess_per - princess_per" href=#>♬ original sound - princess_per - princess_per</a></figure><p>"Thank you for the roses, I liked them," Princess can be heard saying as she walks into the frame of the camera setup that shows her husband and child hanging out.</p><p>"Who'd this come from?" he inquires. A text overlay in the TikToker's video provides an answer to that: "One of my amazing friends sent me roses today."</p><p>It continued: "I took out the card from her and watch this...."</p><p>She didn't tell her significant other this, however. Instead, she said that she thought he was the one who got her the flowers, adding that they came with a message that said, "I love you."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @princess_per</span></figure><p>He walks toward her area and begins looking at the bouquet she said was just delivered. "Oh that's funny, I bet somebody did it for me," he tells her as he leans against the kitchen counter.</p><p>An additional overlay from Princess states that this isn't the first time her birthday has seemed to slip her husband's mind.</p><p>"He forgot my birthday last year too. As the mom, we put together a dinner and bake the cake. When it's my birthday I'm always curious if he will take that initiative," the blurb states.</p><p>Speaking to her husband, she asks him if he was the one who arranged the flower delivery.</p><p>He leaves his answer open-ended, stating that while he may not "remember" doing it there are some times he indeed does get things for her, before he laughs again: "I didn't forget your birthday. How many times have you said, I think Zack forgot my birthday again."</p><p>"I don't know," she says, smiling as she inspects the flowers. "I thought you got me these."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @princess_per</span></figure><p>"No, no, I got you something way cooler than that," he tells her. She writes in another snippet of on-screen text that she doesn't believe he got her anything at all but he's about to leave the house in order to go and buy her a last-minute gift in an attempt to assuage whatever guilt he's feeling for forgetting her birthday yet again.</p><p>"I'm the worst, he still doesn't know these were from a friend," she writes, adding several cry-laughing emojis to the text overlay of the post. And while she seemed to turn the entire post into a laughing manner, there were a lot of people in the comments section of the video who weren't happy to see a man forget his wife's birthday.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @princess_per</span></figure><p>"How many years are we going to allow this ?" one person wrote.</p><p>Another replied: "I am so sorry, you deserve much better. There’s ZERO excuse for this. Happy birthday, gorgeous."</p><p>While someone else simply said that they would dump their significant other if they ever forgot their birthday: "If my husband forgot my birthday every year I’d forget I had a husband."</p><p>One TikTok user said that the main thing they want out of their partner is "acknowledgment" on their birthday and that they aren't necessarily expecting an extravagant gift or anything: "If my husband forgot my birthday he wouldn’t be my husband anymore! I never expect lavish gifts, just an acknowledgement and nice dinner with him and the kids."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @princess_per</span></figure><p>And then there was this TikTok user who painted a scenario that seemed way worse than the one Princess presented in her video: "My husband forgot my birthday and decided on a whim to go out and buy himself a truck that day. The car salesman was the first to say happy birthday after seeing my license."</p><p>Well, unless the "cooler" gift Princess's husband is getting is actually just a new vehicle for himself.</p><p>How important are birthdays to you? Do you think that your significant other should go all out or at least make an attempt to craft a special occasion for you?</p><p>Or is it just about letting someone know they're appreciated, however that may look like?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncK0rsCnm2aen6e0psDSZq6inpVir6q%2B06GbmrFdp7y0sdI%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bbnaija-all-stars-ike-onyema-confesses-to-pimping-bbnaija-girls-to-big-boys.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ike Onyema Confesses To Pimping BBNaija Girls To Big Boys</a>
