The two have been intertwined since 2006 and went on to co-host ITV's This Morning together.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2023, Phillip left the show amid some shocking revelations. So what happened to Holly and Phillip? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened between Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby?</h2><p>On May 26, 2023, Phillip released a statement to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> which left friends, fans, and loved ones shocked. He was exiting This Morning as co-host after more than 20 years on the show. According to the statement, the 61-year-old presenter admitted to cheating on his wife via a consensual relationship with a younger male colleague. Phillip also shared that he lied to ITV as well as his management firm, YMU.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby in 2017</p></figure><p>He was previously asked by the Daily Mail Sunday about this relationship but did not own up to it, which prompted his reveal to the outlet. "I am making this statement via the Daily Mail, to whom I have already apologized personally for misleading, through my lawyer who I also misled, about a story [sic] which they wanted to write about me a few days ago," Phillip said in his statement. He then went into greater detail about the relationship.</p><p>"Contrary to speculation, whilst I met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television, it was only after he started to work on the show that it became more than a just a friendship," revealed Phillip. He assured everyone that the relationship was legal and now over, and proceeded to apologize to all those he had hurt.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield in 2021</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>Philip then resigned from This Morning, leaving the show to scramble for a replacement. He also added, "I will reflect on my very bad judgement in both participating in the relationship and then lying about it." He has also been dropped by his management firm.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Holly Willoughby released a statement after returning to 'This Morning.'</h2><p>Before officially resigning from the show, Phillip had already taken a break in April 2023. Rumors had been swirling for some time about the alleged strained relationship between Phillip and Holly. Many believe it had to do with Phillip reportedly what was going on with his brother, who was "convicted of 11 sexual offenses involving a child between October 2016 and October 2019, including two of sexual activity with a child," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Holly took a break as well following her co-star's exit, and her first day back was June 5. On the show, she took the time to address what happened.</p><p>"It feels very strange indeed, sitting here without Phil," began Holly. "I imagine you've been feeling a lot like I have: shaken, troubled, let down, worried for the well-being of people on all sides of what's been going on, and full of questions."</p><p>It's at this point that we really see how betrayed Holly feels.</p><p>"You, me, and all of us at This Morning gave our love and support to someone who was not telling the truth, who acted in a way that they themselves felt they had to resign from ITV and step down from a career that they loved," she said.</p><p>Holly briefly referenced how this has affected Phillip's mental health, then switched gears to moving on to a new chapter. Holly also took the time to thank everyone who reached out to her with love, kindness, and support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGShp5yhxm7DyKWjqK2Xna%2B6ecCnm2aomJ65rbXPZqqcoJ%2Bbtqa4ww%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ariana-grande-waterboy-adam-sandler.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ariana Grande and Friends Recreated 'Waterboy' Scenes, Adam Sandler Approves</a>
